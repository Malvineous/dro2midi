Another note:

    Rhythm functions (such as Bass Drum, Snare Drum, and Tom Tom, etc) *MUST*
    be setup properly, or they will not sound at all.  In other words, you
    must set the Attack rate, Decay rate, Sustain rate, etc. for the percussion
    instruments just like you would with a regular melodic instrument.

    The channels the percussion instruments are listed as follows:

        Bass Drum:              Modulator *AND* carrier on channel 7.
        Hi Hat:                 Only modulator on channel 8.
        Tom Tom:                Only modulator on channel 9.
        Snare Drum:             Only carrier on channel 8.
        Top Cymbal:             Only carrier on channel 9.

                           The Registers

The following table shows the function of each register in the sound 
card.  Registers will be explained in detail after the table.  Registers
not listed are unused.

   Address      Function
   -------      ----------------------------------------------------
     08         Speech synthesis mode / Keyboard split note select
   20..35       Amp Mod / Vibrato / EG type / Key Scaling / Multiple
   40..55       Key scaling level / Operator output level
   60..75       Attack Rate / Decay Rate
   80..95       Sustain Level / Release Rate
   A0..A8       Frequency (low 8 bits)
   B0..B8       Key On / Octave / Frequency (high 2 bits)
     BD         AM depth / Vibrato depth / Rhythm control
   C0..C8       Feedback strength / Connection type
   E0..F5       Wave Select

The groupings of twenty-two registers (20-35, 40-55, etc.) have an odd
order due to the use of two operators for each FM voice.  The following
table shows the offsets within each group of registers for each operator.


   Channel        1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9
   Operator 1    00  01  02  08  09  0A  10  11  12
   Operator 2    03  04  05  0B  0C  0D  13  14  15

Thus, the addresses of the attack/decay bytes for channel 3 are 62 for
the first operator, and 65 for the second.  (The address of the second
operator is always the address of the first operator plus three).

To further illustrate the relationship, the addresses needed to control
channel 5 are:

    29 - Operator 1  AM/VIB/EG/KSR/Multiplier
    2C - Operator 2  AM/VIB/EG/KSR/Multiplier
    49 - Operator 1  KSL/Output Level
    4C - Operator 2  KSL/Output Level
    69 - Operator 1  Attack/Decay
    6C - Operator 2  Attack/Decay
    89 - Operator 1  Sustain/Release
    8C - Operator 2  Sustain/Release
    A4 -             Frequency (low 8 bits)
    B4 -             Key On/Octave/Frequency (high 2 bits)
    C4 -             Feedback/Connection Type
    E9 - Operator 1  Waveform
    EC - Operator 2  Waveform



                       Explanations of Registers


Byte 08 - CSM Mode / Keyboard Split

        7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     | CSM | Key |              unused               |
     | sel | Spl |                                   |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     
          bit 7 - When set, selects composite sine-wave speech synthesis
                  mode (all KEY-ON bits must be clear).  When clear,
                  selects FM music mode.

          bit 6 - Selects the keyboard split point (in conjunction with
                  the F-Number data).  The documentation in the Sound 
                  Blaster manual is utterly incomprehensible on this;
                  I can't reproduce it without violating their copyright.


Bytes 20-35 - Amplitude Modulation / Vibrato / Envelope Generator Type /
              Keyboard Scaling Rate / Modulator Frequency Multiple

        7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
     | Amp | Vib | EG  | KSR |  Modulator Frequency  |
     | Mod |     | Typ |     |       Multiple        |
     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

          bit 7 - Apply amplitude modulation when set; AM depth is
                  controlled by the AM-Depth flag in address BD.
          bit 6 - Apply vibrato when set;  vibrato depth is controlled
                  by the Vib-Depth flag in address BD.
          bit 5 - When set, the sustain level of the voice is maintained
                  until released; when clear, the sound begins to decay
                  immediately after hitting the SUSTAIN phase.
          bit 4 - Keyboard scaling rate.  This is another incomprehensible
                  bit in the Sound Blaster manual.  From experience, if 
                  this bit is set, the sound's envelope is foreshortened as
                  it rises in pitch.
          bits 3-0 - These bits indicate which harmonic the operator will 
                  produce sound (or modulation) in relation to the voice's 
                  specified frequency:

                      0 - one octave below
                      1 - at the voice's specified frequency
                      2 - one octave above
                      3 - an octave and a fifth above
                      4 - two octaves above
                      5 - two octaves and a major third above
                      6 - two octaves and a fifth above
                      7 - two octaves and a minor seventh above
                      8 - three octaves above
                      9 - three octaves and a major second above
                      A - three octaves and a major third above
                      B - three octaves and a major third above
                      C - three octaves and a fifth above
                      D - three octaves and a fifth above
                      E - three octaves and a major seventh above
                      F - three octaves and a major seventh above
                  

Bytes 40-55 - Level Key Scaling / Total Level

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

          bits 7-6 - causes output levels to decrease as the frequency
                     rises:

                          00   -  no change
                          10   -  1.5 dB/8ve
                          01   -  3 dB/8ve
                          11   -  6 dB/8ve

          bits 5-0 - controls the total output level of the operator.
                     all bits CLEAR is loudest; all bits SET is the
                     softest.  Don't ask me why.


Bytes 60-75 - Attack Rate / Decay Rate

        7     6     5     4     3     2     1     0

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

          bits 7-4 - Attack rate.  0 is the slowest, F is the fastest.
          bits 3-0 - Decay rate.  0 is the slowest, F is the fastest.


Bytes 80-95 - Sustain Level / Release Rate

          bits 7-4 - Sustain Level.  0 is the loudest, F is the softest.
          bits 3-0 - Release Rate.  0 is the slowest, F is the fastest.

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

          bit   5  - Channel is voiced when set, silent when clear.
          bits 4-2 - Octave (0-7).  0 is lowest, 7 is highest.
          bits 1-0 - Most significant bits of F-number.

     In octave 4, the F-number values for the chromatic scale and their 
     corresponding frequencies would be:

     +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

          bits 3-1 - Feedback strength.  If all three bits are set to
                     zero, no feedback is present.  With values 1-7,
                     operator 1 will send a portion of its output back
                     into itself.  1 is the least amount of feedback,
                     7 is the most.
          bit 0    - If set to 0, operator 1 modulates operator 2.  In this
                     case, operator 2 is the only one producing sound.
                     If set to 1, both operators produce sound directly.
                     Complex sounds are more easily created if the connection
                     is set to 0.


Byte BD - Amplitude Modulation Depth / Vibrato Depth / Rhythm

          bit 7 - Set:    AM depth is 4.8dB
                  Clear:  AM depth is 1 dB
          bit 6 - Set:    Vibrato depth is 14 cent
                  Clear:  Vibrato depth is 7 cent
          bit 5 - Set:    Rhythm enabled  (6 melodic voices) 
                  Clear:  Rhythm disabled (9 melodic voices)
          bit 4 - Bass drum on/off
          bit 3 - Snare drum on/off
          bit 2 - Tom tom on/off
          bit 1 - Cymbal on/off
          bit 0 - Hi Hat on/off

          Note:  KEY-ON registers for channels 06, 07, and 08 must be OFF
                 in order to use the rhythm section.  Other parameters
                 such as attack/decay/sustain/release must also be set
                 appropriately.

          bits 1-0 - When bit 5 of address 01 is set, the output waveform
                     will be distorted according to the waveform indicated
                     by these two bits.  I'll try to diagram them here,
                     but this medium is fairly restrictive.
